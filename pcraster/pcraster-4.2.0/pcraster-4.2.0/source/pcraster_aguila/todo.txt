Grep on -w Space and update code which assumes row/col indices. Ook in dal.

Check all references to row/col in
- DataObject
- Map*View

Check all references to dataObject::dataSpaceAddress. Some code might depend on there being row/col indices in there.
- CursorView
- VisEngine

dal::DataSource gets raw spatial coordinates, instead of row/col indices. Update code so it behaves well. read(Table, ...)

dal::Drivers

Remove references to com::toString from all the code, replace by dev::toString.

Replace com::hasElement, com::forWhole, etc (com_algorithm) by dev equivalents.
