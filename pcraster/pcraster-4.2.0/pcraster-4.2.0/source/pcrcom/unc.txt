 Can anyone out there help me with a crystal clear definition of the
Microsoft UNC format (Silver Star)
2) Can you point me to an official Microsoft resource which contains said
definition (Gold Star!)

I am aware of \\servername\sharename etc... What I want to know is, is this
THE format, or not?  For example I have seen a Microsoft knowledge base
article which says...

" the universal naming convention (UNC) for accessing shared resources in
Windows NT is as follows:

\\<servername>\<sharename>\<path>\<file name>"


ok it is simple.

let's say we have a computer named 'lapdog', that computer has 1
hard-drive - C - which is shared as 'Q', on that machine you have a file
called 'ping.exe' which resides in the 'c:\windows' directory.

Then to access the ping.exe file from another machine on the network you
would type

\\lapdog\q\windows\ping.exe

infact you could do the same thing from the machine named lapdog and it
would work equally well.

so from the lapdog machine the following would be equivalent

c:\windows\ping.exe
\\lapdog\q\windows\ping.exe
