Changes
=======

PCRaster 4.2.0
--------------

The most relevant updates for users:

* Python 3 is now the default version on Windows
* The multicore module was added to PCRaster Python
* On Windows, files larger than 2GB can be processed now
* Handling of non-spatials and pcr2numpy was fixed in the PCRaster Python module
* PCRaster Modflow now uses Modflow 2005
* The documentation pages of PCRaster projects were unified into a single manual

We also took measures to improve the code quality and the build system to ensure an ongoing creation of PCRaster packages, amongst others:

* Porting from Qt4 to Qt5
* Updating various dependencies (external libraries)
* Reducing amount of dependencies
* Building against dependencies installed by a package manager
* Removing obsolete scripts and configuration files
* Modernising CMake scripts
* Modernising C and C++ code towards C11 and C++11
* Various fixes raised by compiler warnings
* Various improvements to support Visual Studio 2015
* Various improvements to support clang and macOS


PCRaster 4.1.0
--------------
* On Windows, shared libraries are now installed in a seperate directory called ``lib``, just like on the other platforms. The path to this directory does not have to be listed in the ``$PATH`` environment variable. This has the advantage that the shared libraries shipped with PCRaster will never conflict with shared libraries shipped with other software, and visa versa.

Aguila
^^^^^^
It is now possible again to select a specific column from a timeseries file, like it used to (`Ticket #635 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/635/>`_)

PCRaster Python package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* PCRaster data types can now be serialized by the pickle module (`Ticket #593 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/593/>`_). See also the ``pickle`` Python module. More about this in a future release.

GDAL
^^^^
* The submitted patches for the GDAL PCRaster driver support the dynamic creation of PCRaster maps (`Ticket #664 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/664/>`_) and contain some updates (`Ticket #679 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/679/>`_). We expect the functionality to be integrated in one of the next official GDAL releases.

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Minor updates to documentation of ``spatial``, ``transient`` and ``horizontan`` operations (`Ticket #620 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/620/>`_, `Ticket #677 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/677/>`_, `Ticket #678 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/678/>`_)


PCRaster 4.0.2
--------------

This release improves the reliability of PCRaster applications relating to large data sets, includes functional enhancements for the Modflow extension, and fixes several bugs.

PCRaster 4.0.1
--------------
This is a bug fix release for 4.0.

Global options ``chezy`` and ``manning`` for dynwavestate, dynwaveflux, dynamicwave (pcrcalc, PCRaster Python package)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We discovered a documentation error for the operations dynwavestate, dynwaveflux and dynamicwave.
The manual stated that the Chezy algorithm was the default algorithm to calculate the dynamic flow equation.
In fact, it was calculated by the Manning algorithm by default.

If you did not use any global option, your results were calculated by the Manning equation. From now on, without specifying global options, results will be calculated by the Manning equation as well.

If you used either ``chezy`` or ``manning`` as global option, the corresponding algorithms were used. This behaviour remains unchanged.

To obtain values calculated with the Chezy algorithm, you now need to specify explicitly either
``--chezy`` on the command line, ``#! --chezy`` in PCRcalc scripts, or ``setglobaloption("chezy")`` in Python scripts.

dynamicwave (pcrcalc, PCRaster Python package)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We discovered and fixed a bug in the dynamicwave operation while using the Manning algorithm (`Ticket #609 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/609/>`_).
As the Manning algorithm was used as default (see the remarks above) it is expected that your model results will change.

Aguila
^^^^^^
* Fixed '#624 cannot open .tss files in PCRASTER 4 aguila version' (`Ticket #624 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/624/>`_)

PCRaster Python package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Fixed a wrong number of arguments in the base class for dynamic models (`Ticket #603 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/603/>`_)

resample
^^^^^^^^
* Fixed a regression that caused the generation of MV in all cells while using the crop option (`Ticket #485 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/485/>`_)

pcrcalc
^^^^^^^
* Fixed a redundant timestep output (`Ticket #625 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/625/>`_)

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* The manual pages include updates for the mapattr application and the lookupstate and lookuppotential operations (`Ticket #613 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/613/>`_, `Ticket #601 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/601/>`_)

Developer information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Ported machine_status.py to newer apt_pkg, updated list of required applications for compiling PCRaster (`Ticket #610 <https://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/610/>`_)



PCRaster 4.0.0
--------------
General
^^^^^^^
* Changed the license of all PCRaster source code to the `GPLv3 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>`_ open source license. Moved all sourcecode to the `PCRaster Open Source Tools site <https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcraster/>`_ at SourceForge.
* The installation process of PCRaster has been simplified. On all platforms we distribute a zip file which can be unzipped at a preferred location. After setting two environment variables, PCRaster is ready to be used. The goal is to make it possible to install multiple versions of PCRaster at the same time. This has the advantage that older models can still be run with older installed versions of PCRaster. And it allows us to keep improving PCRaster, even if we break backwards compatibility (we prefer not to, but sometimes there is a good reason).
* Removed support for reading HDF4 formatted rasters. Maintaining support for this format proved to be too much of a hassle.

pcrcalc
^^^^^^^
* Removed support for encrypting models.
* Removed support for license specific functionality (like missing value compression). All features that used to require a commercial license are available for everybody now.

resample
^^^^^^^^
* Fixed the spurious creation of adjacent raster cells while using resample as cookie cutter (`Ticket #463 <http://sourceforge.net/p/pcraster/bugs-and-feature-requests/463/>`_)

PCRaster Python package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Updated the code to allow the garbage collector to reclaim memory used by some of the framework class instanceѕ, after the last reference goes out of scope.
* Updated the code to prevent that the memory used by the PCRaster Python extension increases during a model run.
* PCRaster Python package now depends on Python 2.7.
* PCRaster Python package uses lower case names for package names. Update all PCRaster related imports and change them to lower case. See also the `Style Guide for Python Code <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
* Removed ``pcraster.numpy`` sub-package. Numpy functionality is merged in the ``pcraster`` main package and available without an explicit import of the ``numpy`` sub-package. Remove any import of ``pcraster.numpy`` and rename any calls of ``pcraster.numpy.pcr2numpy`` and ``pcraster.numpy.numpy2pcr`` to ``pcraster.pcr2numpy`` and ``pcraster.numpy2pcr``.
* Removed ``pcr2numarray`` and ``numarray2pcr`` which were already deprecated. Use ``pcr2numpy`` and ``numpy2pcr``.
* Reimplemented ``numpy2pcr``. It is faster now.
* Added a `setclone` overload taking `nrRows`, `nrCols`, `cellSize`, `west`, `north`. No need to pass the name of an existing raster anymore.

MODFLOW extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Fixed a crash.
* Renamed extension from ``PCRasterModflow`` to ``pcraster_modflow``.
