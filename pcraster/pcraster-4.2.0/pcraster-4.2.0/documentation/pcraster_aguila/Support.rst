Comments, questions, ideas, etc
===============================
The ``pcraster-info`` mailing list is a discussion platform for users of PCRaster and related software. The PCRaster R&D team also uses the list to announce new software releases. We recommend that every PCRaster user becomes a member of the list. More information can be found at the `pcraster-info`__ mailing list page. The archives are on the `pcraster-info archives page`__.

Once you are subscribed, you can send your comments, questions, ideas and discussion issues to ``pcraster-info@geo.uu.nl``. English is the preferred language. Imperfect English is no problem, it is a mailing list, not a classroom English.

Report a bug
============
If you think Aguila did something incorrect please file a bug report. Any error messages containing the phrases: "assertion failed" or "programming error" are always errors in the software we should fix. There is a `Bugs and feature requests tracker`__ you can use to file a bug report.

__ http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=205121&atid=992360

Here are some guide lines when submitting a bug report:

* Describe the bug in as much detail as possible.
* Provide (a link to) a zip or archive file with all data and scripts so we can reproduce the bug. If you have a large model (long script and/or much data) try to make a simpler model that still gives the same error.
* Try sending an attachment of your screen showing possible error messages:

  #. Press ``PrntScrn`` (PrintScreen) on your Keyboard.
  #. Open Paint: ``Start->All Programs->Accessories->Paint``.
  #. Copy Screen in untitled: ``Paint Menu->Edit->Paste``.
  #. Save graphics File: ``File->Save`` (type ``.PNG`` is preferred).
  #. Attach the saved file to your email.

Request a feature
=================
You can use the same `Bugs and feature requests tracker`__ as for reporting bugs.
