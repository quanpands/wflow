Introduction
============

This document describes the wflow distributed hydrological modelling platform.
wflow is part of the Deltares'
OpenStreams project (http://www.openstreams.nl). Wflow consists of a
set of python programs that can be run on the command line and perform
hydrological simulations. The models are based on the PCRaster python
framework (www.pcraster.eu). In wflow this framework is extended (the ``wf_DynamicFramework``
class) so that models build using the framework can be controlled using
the API. Links to BMI and OpenDA (www.openda.org)
have been established. All code is available at github (https://github.com/openstreams/wflow/)
and distributed under the GPL version 3.0.

The  wflow distributed hydrological model platform currently includes
the following models:

-  the wflow\_sbm  model (derived from `topog\_sbm <http://www.per.clw.csiro.au/topog/>`_ )

-  the wflow\_hbv model (a distributed version of the HBV96 model).

-  the wflow\_gr4 model (a distributed version of the gr4h/d models).

-  the wflow\_W3RA model (a global hydrological model)

-  the wflow\_routing model (a kinematic wave model that can run on the output of one of the hydrological models
   optionally including a floodplain for more realistic simulations in areas that flood).

-  the wflow\_wave model (a dynamic wave model that can run on the output of the wflow\_routing model).

-  the wflow\_floodmap model (a flood mapping model that can use the output of the wflow\_wave model or de wflow\_routing model).

-  the wflow\_sediment model (an experimental erosion and sediment dynamics model that uses the output of the wflow\_sbm model).

The low level api and links to other frameworks allow the models to be
linked as part of larger modelling systems:

.. note::

    wflow is part of the Deltares OpenStreams project
    (http://www.openstreams.nl). The OpenStreams project is a work in
    progress. Wflow functions as a toolkit for distributed hydrological
    models within OpenStreams.


.. note::

   As part of the eartH2Observe project global dataset of forcing data has been compiled that can also be used with the
   wflow models. A set of tools is available that can work with wflow (the wflow_dem.map file) to extract data from the server and downscale
   these for your wflow model. Check https://github.com/earth2observe/downscaling-tools for the tools. A description
   of the project can be found at http://www.earth2observe.eu and the data server can be access via http://wci.earth2observe.eu


The different wflow models share the same structure but are fairly
different with respect to the conceptualisation. The shared software
framework includes the basic maps (dem, landuse, soil etc) and the
hydrological routing via the kinematic wave. The Python class framework
also exposes the models as an API and is based on the PCRaster/Python
version 4.0 Beta (www.pcraster.eu).

The wflow\_sbm model maximises the use of available spatial data.
Soil depth, for example, is estimated from the DEM using a topographic
wetness index . The model is derived from the [CQFLOW]_ model that has
been applied in various countries, most notably in Central America. The
wflow\_hbv model is derived from the HBV-96 model but does not
include the routing functions, instead it uses the same kinematic wave
routine as the wflow\_sbm  model to route the water downstream.

The models are programmed python using the pcraster python extension.
As such, the structure of the model is
transparent, can be changed by other modellers easily, and the system
allows for rapid development. In order to run
the model both PCRaster 4.* and Python 2.7 are needed. At the moment
only 64 bit versions are  supported.
